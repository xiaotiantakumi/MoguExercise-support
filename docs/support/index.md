## 🆘 Getting Help

### Common Issues

#### AR Not Working
- **Problem**: Camera isn't tracking your face
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure you're using a device with a TrueDepth camera (iPhone X or later)
  - Check that camera permissions are granted
  - Make sure you're in a well-lit environment
  - Hold the device at arm's length with your face clearly visible

#### Chewing Not Detected
- **Problem**: App isn't counting your chews
- **Solution**:
  - Position camera so your entire face is visible
  - Chew normally - the app detects jaw movement
  - Ensure AR tracking is active (look for AR indicator)
  - Try restarting the AR session in app settings

#### App Crashes
- **Problem**: App unexpectedly closes
- **Solution**:
  - Restart your device
  - Ensure you're running the latest iOS version
